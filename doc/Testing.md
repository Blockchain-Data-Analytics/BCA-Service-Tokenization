# Testing

Tests are implemented in [bca-token-solidity/test](./bca-token-solidity/test/) and can be run:

```sh
cd bca-token-solidity
npx hardhat test
```

# Test coverage

How much of the contract's code is covered by tests? This can be answered by:

```sh
cd bca-token-solidity
npx hardhat coverage
```

Which outputs as of today (2024-11-23):

```sh

Clearly, for some of the contracts we have to write some more tests to increase coverage.

# Estimating Gas costs

If we run the tests with the environment variable `REPORT_GAS=true`, then the output will contain information about the Gas usage of the transactions.

```sh
cd bca-token-solidity
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

Will output:
```sh
