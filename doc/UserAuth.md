# User authentication

Users can login to the platform through OpenID with various vencors.

We currently support: Github, Gitlab, Auth0

The first two, Gitlab and Github, require that the user already has an account on their platform. The authentication through Auth0 is the most versatile and users can create an account with their email address.

Once a user has logged in, we have access to their email address and use it as the primary identification.
